# Lavinia-api
## Prerequisites
* [.NET Core Runtime 2.1.2 or SDK 2.1.302](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/2.1)

If you only need to run the API, the runtime will suffice.
## Running the development build
1. Open your favourite terminal and navigate to the repository folder Lavinia-api which contains the file `Lavinia-api.csproj`
2. Type `dotnet run` <kbd>Enter</kbd>

There will be a terminal window that specifies what link to test the API at, usually in the form `localhost:<port>`. Navigate to `localhost:<port>/swagger` for API documentation and available requests.
